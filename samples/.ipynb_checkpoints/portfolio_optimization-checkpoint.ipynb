    "# Portfolio Optimization Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Many indviduals use 401Ks and different retirement tools to help prepare for life after work. Many of these tools depend on managing risk appropiately as to not incure large losses while still taking necessary risk to grow the initial capital. In this series, we will cover the topic of portfolio optimization, a popular technique that financial and investment advisors use to help ensure that their clients are taking appropriate risk to meet their financial objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will be broken into a few different sections with each section buildin on top of each other. The first section we will focus on collecting the data necessary for analysis. The data will be pretty simple, just closing price data for a small portfolio of stocks. While in this tutorial, I will focus on using the NASDAQ as my source of data I will be providing different ways on how to get this data in some supplementary code.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we cover collecting the data, we will then move through the process of preparing the data to calculate a few different metrics that will be crucial for optaining optimial results in our portfolio. A few metrics we will calculate are expected returns, expected volatility, and the Sharpe Ratio. Once we have these metrics defined, we will then move into the process of building a simulation that will randomly generate results that we can use to help determine the optimial results for a wide range of portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take the results of this simulation, plot them using `matplotlib`, and then explore how we can use the `scipy` library to run an optimization algorthim that will return the best weights for our simulation."

    "I think this is a good point to start talking about some of the next steps we are going to do. However, I find it helps to have a high-level overview of the goal, and the tools we will be using to get there. Now at this point, you should recognize that we are using to portfolio of stocks to help generate returns. However, to generate these returns we need to take on **risk**, but ideally we should be comfortable taking on this risk because we are compensated in the form returns that increase our investment.\n",

    "However, most investors aren't okay with taking on high-levels of risk, so our goal is to find the best ratio of risk vs returns. Ideally, we are taking the most risk we are comfortable with and attempting to maximize those returns. That naturally leads to an important question, \"How do we measure risk?\". Well, this can lead you down a rabbit hole because there are many ways to measure risk and some are more appropriate than others depending on the situation at hand. In our case, we will use a very popular metric, the `Sharpe Ratio`. The Sharpe Ratio, is used is a measure for calculating risk-adjusted return and has been the industry standard for such calculations. The Sharpe Ratio allows us to quantify the relationship the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk.\n",

    "# Portfolio Optimization: Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, so we now have a way to evaluate how well our portfolio is allocated. It involves, calculating the expected returns, the expected volatility, and then from here we use the Sharpe Ratio to quantify how well our portfolio is allocated based on a risk perspective. The big question here is, \"If we know that we want to get a higher sharpe ratio, what is the portfolio allocation we need to achieve this?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there are two ways to approach this. First, we could test a bunch of different random allocations and see which ones produces the highest Sharpe Ratio. Second, we could use mathematical optimization defined by some constrains to arrive at the optimial allocation. In the next section, we will run the \"try a bunch of random allocations\" method. Now, there is a more formal name for this process, a Monte Carlo Simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this in python, we will do is run the process we laid out up above and run it a couple thousands of time, and store the results of each run in a data frame. Once we've completed each run, we will find the allocations that produce the highest Sharpe Ratio and the lowest Volatility."

The first one, we can take a look at is the `max_sharpe_ratio`, this is Sharpe Ratio where the excess return of the portfolio is greatest given the amount of risk we are taking on. In other words, these portfolios are \"best\" because they provide the largest risk-adjusted returns. The next metric is the `min_volatiltiy`, these are the weights where the overall volatility of the portfolio is at it's lowest. In other words, if you want to take on the least amount of risk, these are the weights you would want to have. \n",

    "Alright, now remember that up above I mentioned that we would be exploring multiple ways to optimize our portfolio. The first was using Monte Carlo Simulation that would try thousands of random values and find the best values. The draw back to using the Monte Carlo Simulation is that it's not the most efficent way to find the optimial values. Instead we can use mathematical techniques to easily arrive at the optimial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help run this new optimization method, we will need to define a few more functions that we will use in our method. The first function is the `get_metrics()` function which will return the metrics for a given set of weights provided. In other words, think of it as a \"lookup function\" where we can return the results of a certain weight. The second function is the `neg_sharpe` function which is used as a minimization function. The minimization function is used to help find the values which results in the lowest sharpe ratio. In Scipy’s optimize function, there’s no `maximize`, so as an objective function you need to pass something that should be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third function is `check_sum` function which is used as a constraint. What is will do is make sure that the weights that are passed through meet the constraint that we must have a portfolio allocation equal 100%, not more and not less."

    "Okay with our functions now defined, let's run the optimization using the `scipy.optimization` module. This module has a function called `minimize` which we can use to help our optimial values. However, we need to do a few things before we run it. First, we need to define bounds which tells the minimize function that each of our positions can only be between 0% and 100% of the allocation. Second, we need to define the constraint which will be a `fun`(function) that ensures we `equ`(equal) a 100% allocated portfolio. In other words, we use all the \"capital\" we can. Third, we need to define our initial guess of the weights. The initial guess can be anything but in this case let's make it easy and start with an equally distirbuted portofolio. In this case we have 4 symbols so each symbol will be 25% of the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've define this steps we can run the optimization by passing through the arguments defined and defining the `method` as `SLSQP` which is short for `Sequential Least Squares Programming`. Now, the different optimization methods are a whole different topic and is outside the scope of this tutorial. Once we run the `minimize` method we can grab the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is the results of our minimization operation. Inside the results, you'll see the optimize sharpe ration defined by the `fun` value. We can then take the `optimized_weights` defined by the `optimized_sharpe.x` values, and use them to return the different metrics we have for our portfolio."
